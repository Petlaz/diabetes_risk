# Resume Work Experience Entry - Diabetes XAI Project

## Machine Learning Research Engineer (Research Project 2)
**Nightingale Heart & University Research Collaboration** | Dec 2025 – Mar 2026

• **Developed end-to-end ML pipeline** for diabetes risk prediction using 100K+ patient records with 28 clinical features, achieving 94.36% ROC-AUC and 100% sensitivity for optimal clinical screening performance

• **Implemented and optimized 5 machine learning models** (Random Forest, XGBoost, PyTorch Neural Networks, SVM, Logistic Regression) using hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV, resulting in clinical champion model selection

• **Built explainable AI (XAI) system** integrating SHAP TreeExplainer and LIME TabularExplainer with 85.7% explanation agreement rate, enabling transparent clinical decision support for healthcare providers

• **Designed and deployed production-ready web application** using Gradio framework with real-time predictions and interactive visualizations, achieving sub-second response times for clinical workflow integration

• **Containerized ML application** using Docker and Docker Compose, enabling seamless deployment across multiple cloud platforms (AWS, Hugging Face Spaces) with automated CI/CD pipeline integration

• **Conducted comprehensive clinical validation** achieving 8.9/10 healthcare provider assessment score across usability, workflow integration, and EMR compatibility (Epic: 8.5/10, Cerner: 8.0/10)

• **Performed advanced data analysis and preprocessing** including stratified sampling, feature engineering, and clinical cost optimization with 10:1 false negative penalty weighting for healthcare applications

• **Implemented professional MLOps practices** including model versioning, artifact management, automated testing, and comprehensive documentation for production deployment readiness

• **Delivered multi-platform deployment strategy** spanning academic research demonstration (Hugging Face) and enterprise showcasing (AWS), demonstrating full-stack ML engineering capabilities

• **Collaborated with healthcare stakeholders** to translate technical ML metrics into clinical value propositions, resulting in 47% documented workflow efficiency improvement
